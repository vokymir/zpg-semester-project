# TODO

- Repair jumps
- I once dropped through the floor when jumping
- sooo, jumps. i mean you can jump a little. when holding space, only one jump is performed. The jump is weirdly slow and you get a look onto the higher floor sometimes.
- i checked, you get a sneak-peak when colliding with floors, should look into that - probably because they are so thin...
- Check if loading works correctly
